## Overview



**Objective:** Build an app that is functionally similar to this: https://bar-chart.freecodecamp.rocks.

Fulfill the below user stories and get all of the tests to pass. 

**User Story #1:** My chart should have a title with a corresponding id="title". <br>
**User Story #2:** My chart should have a g element x-axis with a corresponding id="x-axis". <br>
**User Story #3:** My chart should have a g element y-axis with a corresponding id="y-axis". <br>
**User Story #4:** Both axes should contain multiple tick labels, each with a corresponding class="tick". <br>
**User Story #5:** My chart should have a rect element for each data point with a corresponding class="bar" displaying the data. <br>
**User Story #6:** Each bar should have the properties data-date and data-gdp containing date and GDP values. <br>
**User Story #7:** The bar elements' data-date properties should match the order of the provided data. <br>
**User Story #8:** The bar elements' data-gdp properties should match the order of the provided data. <br>
**User Story #9:** Each bar element's height should accurately represent the data's corresponding GDP. <br>
**User Story #10:** The data-date attribute and its corresponding bar element should align with the corresponding value on the x-axis. <br>
**User Story #11:** The data-gdp attribute and its corresponding bar element should align with the corresponding value on the y-axis. <br>
**User Story #12:** I can mouse over an area and see a tooltip with a corresponding id="tooltip" which displays more information about the area. <br>
**User Story #13:** My tooltip should have a data-date property that corresponds to the data-date of the active area. <br>
